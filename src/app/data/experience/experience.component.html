            <P>For me, looking to improve skills during my internship, setting clear goals, seeking feedback, and
                regular practice are key. Engaging in hands-on projects, effective communication with colleagues,
                and utilizing online resources are crucial steps. Networking and attending workshops also contribute
                to my professional growth. By being proactive and open to learning, I can make the most of my
                internship experience, developing essential skills for my career journey.
